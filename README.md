The following code includes Autoregressive RNN architecture, which means the last state of the RNN will be fed into the prediction model. The RNN model will try to predict 1 hour (can be adjusted) in the future (horizon) by looking at the 24 hours (can be adjusted) in the past of all the features shared in the dataset. Additionally, "time" is added as a feature in this model as well, and since it is periodic cos and sin components are taken into account.
